  Abstract                 = {The first soil maps were made by geologists, and many early soil maps were surficial geology maps. After soil science became established as a scientific discipline, there has been a continued interplay between geologists and soil scientists, both fields benefiting from advancements made by the other. In the 1940s and 1950s, researchers began to use soil information and soil maps to assist in the improvement or construction of various types of geologic maps. There is strong agreement between preliminary geology maps created from soil maps and traditional geology maps. This is primarily due to the influence of parent material on soil formation and may also be due in part to the importance placed on parent material in some soil classification systems. Despite the results obtained when using soil maps to create surficial geology maps, there is a need for more quantitative studies to assess the degree of compliment between soil-based maps and traditional geology maps, expansion of the technique into a wider range of geologic and climatic environments, and more research in locations that use classification systems other than US soil taxonomy.},

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) provide the framework for the implementation of different complex techniques for the assessment of shallow landsliding and erosion processes in mountain basins. This paper presents some morphometric indicators aimed at erosion and sediment delivery analysis. The proposed indicators can be easily derived from medium to fine resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Applications conducted in Eastern Italian Alps have shown the adequateness of the proposed approach to address erosion and sediment-related problems. The analysis considered the classification of sediment source areas with regard to their activity, the comparison between drainage basins having different morphological characteristics and the topographic control on sediment transport capacity, with a particular attention to the identification of channel reaches characterised by a low sediment transport capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports a close link between terrain ruggedness and forage availability for caribou during snowmelt. Indices of terrain ruggedness based on contour characteristics from topographical maps were related to field measures of cover, biomass, and live/dead ratio of graminoids within the Kuparuk Oilfield, Alaska. Terrain ruggedness was found to be the most significant factor affecting forage availability during snowmelt within the study area. Terrain ruggedness was positively correlated to 1) graminoid cover within wet, moist and dry herbaceous tundra, 2) cover of four individual graminoid species, 3) height of Salixplanifolia, 4) amount of Eriophorum vaginatum flowers, and 5) live/dead ratio of plant material during early and late snowmelt. The live/dead ratio of plant material varied among vegetation types during snowmelt, causing rugged areas to have sprouting green plant material available for forage throughout this period. While annual differences in snow depths and snowmelt will affect forage availability in a given year, indices of terrain ruggedness combined with vegetation maps can substantially improve our understanding of how forage availability for caribou may vary across the landscape during snowmelt. /// Cet article rapporte le lien Ã©troit qui existe entre le caractÃ¨re accidentÃ© du terrain et la disponibilitÃ© d'herbage pour le caribou durant la fonte nivale. On a reliÃ© les indices d'aspÃ©ritÃ© du terrain dÃ©terminÃ©s par les caractÃ©ristiques des courbes de niveaux sur les cartes topographiques aux mesures sur le terrain du tapis, de la biomasse et du rapport de graminÃ©es vivantes aux graminÃ©es mortes dans le champ pÃ©trolifÃ¨re Kuparuk en Alaska. On a trouvÃ© que l'aspÃ©ritÃ© du terrain Ã©tait le facteur le plus important affectant la disponibilitÃ© d'herbage durant la fonte nivale dans la zone d'Ã©tude. L'aspÃ©ritÃ© du terrain Ã©tait corrÃ©lÃ©e de faÃ§on positive 1) au couvert de graminÃ©es de la toundra herbacÃ©e saturÃ©e d'eau, humide et sÃ¨che, 2) au couvert de quatre espÃ¨ces individuelles de graminÃ©es, 3) Ã  la hauteur de Salix planifolia, 4) Ã  la quantitÃ© de fleurs de Eriophorum vaginaÃ®um et 5) au rapport du matÃ©riau vÃ©gÃ©tal vivant au matÃ©riau vÃ©gÃ©tal mort au dÃ©but et Ã  la fin de la fonte nivale. Le rapport de ces deux sortes de matÃ©riau vÃ©gÃ©tal variait parmi les types de vÃ©gÃ©tation durant la fonte nivale, ce qui faisait que les zones accidentÃ©es avaient de nouvelles pousses de matÃ©riau vÃ©gÃ©tal disponibles comme herbage durant toute cette pÃ©riode. Bien que les diffÃ©rences d'une annÃ©e Ã  l'autre dans l'Ã©paisseur de la neige et dans la fonte nivale aient des rÃ©percussions sur la disponibilitÃ© d'herbage au cours d'une annÃ©e donnÃ©e, des indices de l'aspÃ©ritÃ© du terrain combinÃ©s aux cartes de vÃ©gÃ©tation peuvent nous aider considÃ©rablement Ã  comprendre comment la disponibilitÃ© d'herbage pour le caribou peut varier dans tout le territoire au cours de la fonte nivale.},

Most methods used to quantify ruggedness are indices derived from measures of slope and, as a result, are strongly correlated with slope. Using a Geographic Information System, we developed a vector ruggedness measure (VRM) of terrain based on a geomorphological method for measuring vector dispersion that is less correlated with slope. We examined the relationship of VRM to slope and to 2 commonly used indices of ruggedness in 3 physiographically different mountain ranges within the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. We used VRM, slope, distance to water, and springtime bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) adult female locations to model sheep habitat in the 3 ranges. Using logistic regression, we determined that the importance of ruggedness in habitat selection remained consistent across mountain ranges, whereas the relative importance of slope varied according to the characteristic physiography of eac...},
