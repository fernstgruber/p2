  Abstract                 = {Abstract As soil surveys were traditionally conducted in support of agriculture, soil classification tended to focus on upper soil horizons and their characteristics. However, when dealing with environmental issues – such as vegetation ecology or water quality – an integrated knowledge of the soil, soil-to-substratum, and deeper substratum continuum is required. In both World Reference Base for soil resources (WRB) and Soil Taxonomy (ST), the lower boundary for soil classification is arbitrarily set at 2 m, including weathered and continuous rock. However, as soil classification hinges on diagnostic horizons and characteristics, which often occur within the first 100 cm, collecting data on the subsolum is often neglected. We propose a classification system of the subsolum, the structure of which is inspired by WRB. We define Regolite, Saprolite, Saprock and Bedrock as four subsolum reference groups corresponding to different weathering stages. Intergrades of these reference groups can be qualified with principal qualifiers, while morphologic and lithologic characteristics can be presented with supplementary qualifiers. The proposed subsolum classification system is not intended to substitute geological surveys, but rather to complement existing soil classification systems such that at least the whole 2 m can be categorized. Still, whenever desired the system can also be used for deeper materials. },

  Abstract                 = {Watershed management and headwater reconstruction programs require a reliable knowledge of sediment dynamics. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) provide the framework for the implementation of different complex techniques for the assessment of shallow landsliding and erosion processes in mountain basins. This paper presents some morphometric indicators aimed at erosion and sediment delivery analysis. The proposed indicators can be easily derived from medium to fine resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Applications conducted in Eastern Italian Alps have shown the adequateness of the proposed approach to address erosion and sediment-related problems. The analysis considered the classification of sediment source areas with regard to their activity, the comparison between drainage basins having different morphological characteristics and the topographic control on sediment transport capacity, with a particular attention to the identification of channel reaches characterised by a low sediment transport capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {Terrain ruggedness is often an important variable in wildlife habitat models. Most methods used to quantify ruggedness are indices derived from measures of slope and, as a result, are strongly correlated with slope. Using a Geographic Information System, we developed a vector ruggedness measure (VRM) of terrain based on a geomorphological method for measuring vector dispersion that is less correlated with slope. We examined the relationship of VRM to slope and to 2 commonly used indices of ruggedness in 3 physiographically different mountain ranges within the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. We used VRM, slope, distance to water, and springtime bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) adult female locations to model sheep habitat in the 3 ranges. Using logistic regression, we determined that the importance of ruggedness in habitat selection remained consistent across mountain ranges, whereas the relative importance of slope varied according to the characteristic physiography of eac...},
