  Abstract                 = {Parameters correlated to surface roughness are quite commonly used to describe landslide activity in quantitative geomorphology. Previous studies proved that topographic roughness is closely related to both landslide mechanics and features. A number of different techniques have emerged over the years to describe quantitatively the great variety of landforms and processes that affect unstable slopes. In this work we perform a comparative analysis of several methods used in literature to compute surface roughness (root mean square applied to elevation and slope grids, eigenvalue ratios, semivariance, discrete Fourier transform, continuous wavelet transform and wavelet lifting scheme) in order to evaluate quantitatively which algorithms are best suited to discriminate active landslides and to predict them for automated mapping purposes. A first test was carried out on artificial surfaces simulating different roughness patterns encountered in nature, so to highlight advantages and limits in controlled conditions. Then, the algorithms were applied to LiDAR datasets of two earth flow case studies in the Northern Apennines, Italy. Results obtained by using “effect-size” statistical test to objectively quantify the capability of the different algorithms of discriminating active landslide slopes from other slope types showed that most algorithms perform reasonably well and that simple techniques (RMS-based and wavelet lifting scheme) achieve equal or sometimes even better results that more complex ones. Results from the use of roughness indexes for the prediction of landslide slopes in automated mapping showed that non-forested active slopes could be predicted by most methods with an accuracy greater than 85% and that most methods had a 15% drop in prediction accuracy in forested active slopes. Results also proved that increasing the size of the moving window has minor beneficial effects in predictive capability, suggesting that small size of pixels and moving windows should be used to retain a full resolution of surface conditions in slopes. },

  Abstract                 = {The first soil maps were made by geologists, and many early soil maps were surficial geology maps. After soil science became established as a scientific discipline, there has been a continued interplay between geologists and soil scientists, both fields benefiting from advancements made by the other. In the 1940s and 1950s, researchers began to use soil information and soil maps to assist in the improvement or construction of various types of geologic maps. There is strong agreement between preliminary geology maps created from soil maps and traditional geology maps. This is primarily due to the influence of parent material on soil formation and may also be due in part to the importance placed on parent material in some soil classification systems. Despite the results obtained when using soil maps to create surficial geology maps, there is a need for more quantitative studies to assess the degree of compliment between soil-based maps and traditional geology maps, expansion of the technique into a wider range of geologic and climatic environments, and more research in locations that use classification systems other than US soil taxonomy.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract For quantifying and modelling of landscape patterns, the patch matrix model (PMM) and the gradient model (GM) are fundamental concepts of landscape ecology. While the \{PMM\} model has been the backbone for our advances in landscape ecology, it may also hamper truly universal insights into process–pattern relationships. The \{PMM\} describes landscape structures as a mosaic of discretely delineated homogenous areas. This requires simplifications and assumptions which may even result in errors which propagate through subsequent analyses and may reduce our ability to understand effects of landscape structure on ecological processes. Alternative approaches to represent landscape structure should therefore be evaluated. The \{GM\} represents continuous surface characteristics without arbitrary vegetation or land-use classification and therefore does not require delineation of discrete areas with sharp boundaries. The \{GM\} therefore lends itself to be a more realistic representation of a particular surface characteristic. In the paper \{PMM\} and \{GM\} are compared regarding their prospects and limitations. Suggestions are made regarding the potential use and implementation of both approaches for process–pattern analysis. The ecological and anthropogenic process itself and its characteristics under investigation is decisive for: (i) the selection of discrete and/or continuous indicators, (ii) the type of the quantitative pattern analysis approach to be used (PMM/GM) and (iii) the data and the scale required in the analysis. Process characteristics and their effects on pattern characteristics in space and time are decisive for the applicability of the \{PMM\} or of the \{GM\} approach. A low hemeroby (high naturalness and low human pressure on landscapes) allows for high internal-heterogeneity in space and over time within patterns. Such landscapes can be captured with the \{GM\} approach. A high hemeroby reduces heterogeneity in space and time within patterns. For such landscapes we recommend the \{PMM\} model. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The lunar global texture maps of roughness and entropy are derived at kilometer scales from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) data obtained by Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) aboard on Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft. We use statistical moments of a gray-level histogram of elevations in a neighborhood to compute the roughness and entropy value. Our texture descriptors measurements are shown in global maps at multi-sized square neighborhoods, whose length of side is 3, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 pixels, respectively. We found that large-scale topographical changes can only be displayed in maps with longer side of neighborhood, but the small scale global texture maps are more disorderly and unsystematic because of more complicated textures' details. Then, the frequency curves of texture maps are made out, whose shapes and distributions are changing as the spatial scales increases. Entropy frequency curve with minimum 3-pixel scale has large fluctuations and six peaks. According to this entropy curve we can classify lunar surface into maria, highlands, different parts of craters preliminarily. The most obvious textures in the middle-scale roughness and entropy maps are the two typical morphological units, smooth maria and rough highlands. For the impact crater, its roughness and entropy value are characterized by a multiple-ring structure obviously, and its different parts have different texture results. In the last, we made a 2D scatter plot between the two texture results of typical lunar maria and highlands. There are two clusters with largest dot density which are corresponded to the lunar highlands and maria separately. In the lunar mare regions (cluster A), there is a high correlation between roughness and entropy, but in the highlands (Cluster B), the entropy shows little change. This could be subjected to different geological processes of maria and highlands forming different landforms. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In general, textures are thought to be some complicated repeated patterns formed by elements, or primitives which are sorted in certain rules. Lunar surfaces record the interactions between its outside environment and itself, thus, based on high-resolution \{DEM\} model or image data, there are some topographic features which have different roughness and entropy values or signatures on lunar surfaces. Textures of lunar surfaces can help us to concentrate on typical topographic and photometric variations and reveal the relationships between obvious features (craters, impact basins, sinuous rilles (SRs) and ridges) with resurfacing processes on the Moon. In this paper, the term surface roughness is an expression of the variability of a topographic or photometric surface at kilometer scale, and the term entropy can characterize the variability inherent in a geological and topographic unit and evaluate the uncertainty of predictions made by a given geological process. We use the statistical moments of gray-level histograms in different-sized neighborhoods (e.g., 3, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 pixels) to compute the kilometer-scale roughness and entropy values, using the mosaic image from 70°N to 70°S obtained by Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Wide Angle Camera (WAC). Large roughness and entropy signatures were only found in the larger scale maps, while the smallest 3-pixel scale map had more disorderly and unsystematic textures. According to the entropy values in 10-pixel scale entropy map, we made a frequency curve and categorized lunar surfaces into three types, shadow effects, maria and highlands. A 2D scatter plot of entropy versus roughness values was produced and we found that there were two point clusters corresponding to the highlands and maria, respectively. In the last, we compared the topographic and photometric signatures derived from Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data and \{WAC\} mosaic image. On the lunar surfaces, the ridges have obvious multilevel topographic textures which are sensitive to the topographic changes, while the ejecta deposits of fresh craters appear obvious photometric textures which are sensitive to the brightness variations. },

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) provide the framework for the implementation of different complex techniques for the assessment of shallow landsliding and erosion processes in mountain basins.

The proposed indicators can be easily derived from medium to fine resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Applications conducted in Eastern Italian Alps have shown the adequateness of the proposed approach to address erosion and sediment-related problems. The analysis considered the classification of sediment source areas with regard to their activity, the comparison between drainage basins having different morphological characteristics and the topographic control on sediment transport capacity, with a particular attention to the identification of channel reaches characterised by a low sediment transport capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern landscape ecology is based on the patch mosaic paradigm, in which landscapes are conceptualized and analyzed as mosaics of discrete patches. While this model has been widely successful, there are many situations where it is more meaningful to model landscape structure based on continuous rather than discrete spatial heterogeneity. The growing field of surface metrology offers a variety of surface metrics for quantifying landscape gradients, yet these metrics are largely unknown and/or unused by landscape ecologists. In this paper, we describe a suite of surface metrics with potential for landscape ecological application. We assessed the redundancy among metrics and sought to find groups of similarly behaved metrics by examining metric performance across 264 sample landscapes in western Turkey. For comparative purposes and to evaluate the robustness of the observed patterns, we examined 16 different patch mosaic models and 18 different landscape gradient models of landscape structure. Surface metrics were highly redundant, but less so than patch metrics, and consistently aggregated into four cohesive clusters of similarly behaved metrics representing surface roughness, shape of the surface height distribution, and angular and radial surface texture. While the surface roughness metrics have strong analogs among the patch metrics, the other surface components are largely unique to landscape gradients. We contend that the surface properties we identified are nearly universal and have potential to offer new insights into landscape pattern--process relationships.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports a close link between terrain ruggedness and forage availability for caribou during snowmelt. Indices of terrain ruggedness based on contour characteristics from topographical maps were related to field measures of cover, biomass, and live/dead ratio of graminoids within the Kuparuk Oilfield, Alaska. Terrain ruggedness was found to be the most significant factor affecting forage availability during snowmelt within the study area. Terrain ruggedness was positively correlated to 1) graminoid cover within wet, moist and dry herbaceous tundra, 2) cover of four individual graminoid species, 3) height of Salixplanifolia, 4) amount of Eriophorum vaginatum flowers, and 5) live/dead ratio of plant material during early and late snowmelt. The live/dead ratio of plant material varied among vegetation types during snowmelt, causing rugged areas to have sprouting green plant material available for forage throughout this period. While annual differences in snow depths and snowmelt will affect forage availability in a given year, indices of terrain ruggedness combined with vegetation maps can substantially improve our understanding of how forage availability for caribou may vary across the landscape during snowmelt. /// Cet article rapporte le lien étroit qui existe entre le caractère accidenté du terrain et la disponibilité d'herbage pour le caribou durant la fonte nivale. On a relié les indices d'aspérité du terrain déterminés par les caractéristiques des courbes de niveaux sur les cartes topographiques aux mesures sur le terrain du tapis, de la biomasse et du rapport de graminées vivantes aux graminées mortes dans le champ pétrolifère Kuparuk en Alaska. On a trouvé que l'aspérité du terrain était le facteur le plus important affectant la disponibilité d'herbage durant la fonte nivale dans la zone d'étude. L'aspérité du terrain était corrélée de façon positive 1) au couvert de graminées de la toundra herbacée saturée d'eau, humide et sèche, 2) au couvert de quatre espèces individuelles de graminées, 3) à la hauteur de Salix planifolia, 4) à la quantité de fleurs de Eriophorum vaginaîum et 5) au rapport du matériau végétal vivant au matériau végétal mort au début et à la fin de la fonte nivale. Le rapport de ces deux sortes de matériau végétal variait parmi les types de végétation durant la fonte nivale, ce qui faisait que les zones accidentées avaient de nouvelles pousses de matériau végétal disponibles comme herbage durant toute cette période. Bien que les différences d'une année à l'autre dans l'épaisseur de la neige et dans la fonte nivale aient des répercussions sur la disponibilité d'herbage au cours d'une année donnée, des indices de l'aspérité du terrain combinés aux cartes de végétation peuvent nous aider considérablement à comprendre comment la disponibilité d'herbage pour le caribou peut varier dans tout le territoire au cours de la fonte nivale.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Landscape metrics are commonly used indicators of ecological pattern and processes in ecological modelling. Numerous landscape metrics are available, making the selection of appropriate metrics a common challenge in model development. In this paper, we tested the performance of methods for preselecting sets of three landscape metrics for use in modelling species richness of six groups of organisms (woody plants, orchids, orthopterans, amphibians, reptiles, and small terrestrial birds) and overall species richness in a Mediterranean forest landscape. The tested methods included expert knowledge, decision tree analysis, principal component analysis, and principal component regression. They were compared with random choice and optimal sets, which were evaluated by testing all possible combinations of metrics. All pre-selection methods performed significantly worse than the optimal sets. The statistical approaches performed slightly better than random choice that in turn performed slightly better than sets derived by expert knowledge. We concluded that the process of selecting the most appropriate landscape metrics for modelling biodiversity is not trivial and that shortcuts to systematic evaluation of metrics should not be expected to identify appropriate indicators. },
